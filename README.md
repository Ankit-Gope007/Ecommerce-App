# 🛍️ ShopEase — Your All-in-One eCommerce Experience

**ShopEase** is a fully functional, full-stack eCommerce platform where buyers and sellers meet with ease. From categorized product listings to a smooth cart and billing system, ShopEase offers a real-world shopping experience — minus the payment gateway.

This was my **first full-stack app**, and I learned *more building it than watching countless tutorials*. Every feature was handcrafted using modern web technologies to create a responsive, scalable, and practical eCommerce solution.
